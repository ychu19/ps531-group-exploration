Your friend at the UN (who needs a name) was so impressed with your help, and
especially with the videos of the Quincunx demonstrating the relationship
between the binomial and the Normal distribution, that she has called back.
She says, "After I presented the news that the bombing caused an increase in
volunteering of about 45 minutes, I was immediately attacked by people
claiming that I was making unfair comparisons. Maybe, they said, the people
interviewed before the bombing were just less active in general for all sorts
of other reasons having nothing to do with the bombing, but, after the
bombing, the survey field research team tended to interview people who were
likely to be active --- like people with more education, etc. I hired another
couple of analysts to look into this --- to make my comparisons more fair and
I'm wondering if you'd take a look at what they did before they fled...mean,
left and went to bed."

covariates <- names(covariatesLabels)
```

This summary of the effect of the bombings has a couple of problems: First, we
wondered about whether summarizing differences using a simple mean might be
misleading --- we might not use the mean as a one-number summary in the first
place, but might prefer something else that is less sensitive to extreme
values (like a median-regression or some robust/resistant regression using an
M-estimator). Second, and most importantly, after reading
@rosenbaum2010design (especially chapters 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 13) and
@gelman2007dau (especially chapters 9 and 10) we wondered whether we
could claim that we were comparing like with like --- that, in fact, the
comparison of behavior before versus after the bombing could be said to be
like a natural experiment allowing a clear counterfactual
comparison.\footnote{We also recommend @gerber2012field Chap 1 and 2 for more on
  counterfactual comparisons if the issue is not clear from Rosenbaum or
  Gelman and Hill.}

These plots suggest do not make us worry too much about the common
support/extrapolation problem with respect to two covariates (assuming that
residential tenure and household income are truly covariates and not
post-intervention variables). However, these plots do raise questions about
the parallel lines requirement.

```{r }
effect2lm<-lm(hlphrs~postbomb+SLive,data=wrkdat)
effect3lm<-lm(hlphrs~postbomb+hhinc,data=wrkdat)
```

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width=".95\\textwidth",fig.width=12,fig.height=6}
par(mfrow=c(1,2),pty="s",mgp=c(1.5,.5,0),oma=rep(0,4))

with(wrkdat,{
       plot(SLive,hlphrs,
	    pch=c(1,19)[postbomb+1],
	    cex=c(1.3,.8)[postbomb+1],
	    col=c("black","gray")[postbomb+1])
       abline(coef(effect2lm)[1]+coef(effect2lm)[2]*1,coef(effect2lm)[3],col="gray",lwd=2)
       abline(coef(effect2lm)[1]+coef(effect2lm)[2]*0,coef(effect2lm)[3],lwd=2)
       plot(hhinc,hlphrs,
	    pch=c(1,19)[postbomb+1],
	    cex=c(1.3,.8)[postbomb+1],
	    col=c("black","gray")[postbomb+1])
       abline(coef(effect3lm)[1]+coef(effect3lm)[2]*1,coef(effect3lm)[3],col="gray",lwd=2)
       abline(coef(effect3lm)[1]+coef(effect3lm)[2]*0,coef(effect3lm)[3],lwd=2)
}
)
legend(x="topright",pch=c(1,19),
       col=c("black","gray"),
       legend=c("PreBomb","PostBomb"))
```

We next tried to control for both variables, but this next plot caused us to
worry about the curse of dimensionality. For example, you cannot claim to
control for both high household income and long home tenure when making this
comparison: years lived in a neighborhood are related to household income and
so the data are not spread evenly across the scatterplot.

```{r }
effect4lm<-lm(hlphrs~postbomb+hhinc+SLive,data=wrkdat)
```

```{r out.width=".5\\textwidth", fig.align="center"}
with(wrkdat,{ plot(hhinc,SLive,
		   pch=c(1,19)[postbomb+1],
		   cex=c(1.3,.8)[postbomb+1],
		   col=c("black","gray")[postbomb+1]) })

```

Your friend asks, "What are they talking about? Why should the first plots
make me feel good but the second plot not? Why can't I claim that I've
controlled for two variables in some overarching manner? What is the problem?"

Then she continues, "Because I didn't like the answers I was getting from
those guys, I fired them and hired someone else who claimed that it would be
easy to control for as many variables as a I wanted. Here is what he said."

This is easy. This is exactly what multiple regression was built for. Watch this!

```{r results="hide"}

lm1<-lm(hlphrs~GOR + Rsex + Rdmstat + Rage + Ethnic11 + RILO4A + hhinc +
	ZQuals1 + DVHSize + immigrant + workstatus + SLive + relig.and.act +
	Rnssec17 + HTen1, data=wrkdat)

hlphrsWithNoCovs<-residuals(lm1)

lm2<-lm(postbomb~GOR + Rsex + Rdmstat + Rage + Ethnic11 + RILO4A + hhinc +
	ZQuals1 + DVHSize + immigrant + workstatus + SLive + relig.and.act +
	Rnssec17 + HTen1, data=wrkdat)

postbombWithNoCovs<-residuals(lm2)

effect5lm<-lm(hlphrsWithNoCovs~postbombWithNoCovs)
coef(effect5lm)[[2]]

lmbig<-lm(hlphrs~postbomb+GOR + Rsex + Rdmstat + Rage + Ethnic11 + RILO4A + hhinc +
	ZQuals1 + DVHSize + immigrant + workstatus + SLive + relig.and.act +
	Rnssec17 + HTen1, data=wrkdat)

```

"But,", your friend sighs, "Now I don't get this. What is this person doing?
In what sense does the `coef(effect5lm)[[2]]` represent a comparison
that has been purged of possible confounding? Has this approach 'controlled
for' enough?^[To answer the first part, you might consider the more
  traditional multiple regression way of controlling for many variables.]

After you answer her questions, she calls back. "I fired this second analyst
and hired another group. They claim that they can help me know whether I am
adjusting or controlling for background, observed, covariates appropriately or
not. Can you help me judge whether they are making sense?"

Dear Commander,

Here is another approach which is based on the idea that we should be able to
report on how good of a job we did at controlling for. That is, statistical
adjustment should have standards.

First, we might ask whether the initial comparison made sense: were people
interviewed after the bombing that different from people interviewed before
the bombing? This next approach was developed by @hansen2008cbs.

```{r results='hide'}
library(RItools)

balfmla<-reformulate(covariates[1:15],response="postbomb")

xb1<-xBalance(balfmla,data=wrkdat,
	      report=c("std.diffs","z.scores","adj.means",
                    "adj.mean.diffs", "chisquare.test","p.values"))

print(xb1,horizontal=TRUE,show.pvals=TRUE)
## xb1$overall
## xb1$results

```

For example, we can say that none of the variables had pre-vs-post-bombing
differences larger, in absolute value, than about .23 of a standard deviation
and that the worst differences pre-vs-post bombing were in terms of whether
people lived in the North West region, White
ethnicity, and martial status. For example, the sample before the bombing was
about 68\% White ethnicity but about 56\% White ethnicity after the bombing.
Overall, however, we do not have enough information to argue strongly against
the null hypothesis that people interviewed before and after the bombing
differed only as they would have differed in a randomized experiment. Notice,
for example, about 9\% of the people before the bombing refused to report a
household income (hhinc==NA) and about 11\% of people interviewed after the
bombing refused to report a household income.

```{r results="hide"}
summary(abs(xb1$results[,"std.diff","unstrat"]))
xb1$results[order(abs(xb1$results[,"std.diff","unstrat"])),"std.diff","unstrat"]
xb1$results["Ethnic11White",,]
xb1$results[c("hhinc","hhinc.NATRUE"),,]
xb1$overall
```

Our research group next tried to improve this "balance". We would like to
create sets which only compare at least one person interviewed before the
bombing with at least one person after the bombing. These sets are supposed to
contain people who are similar in terms of all of the background covariates
--- so that our pre-vs-post comparisons ought not reflect differences due to
the background covariates (and thus, reflect either differences due to the
bombing or to covariates that we do not observe). We have not yet been paid by
your organization so we leave the interpretation of the following to you.

```{r }
library(optmatch)

newdata<-fill.NAs(balfmla,data=wrkdat) ## We want to match on missingness too
names(newdata)<-make.names(names(newdata))

propensityModel<-glm(postbomb~.,data=newdata,family=binomial(link="logit"))
psDistMat<-match_on(propensityModel,data=newdata)

mhDistMat<-match_on(postbomb~.,data=newdata,method="rank_mahalanobis")
summary(as.vector(psDistMat))

##tmp <- wrkdat$Rage
##names(tmp) <- rownames(wrkdat)
##absdist <- match_on(tmp, z = wrkdat$postbomb,
##                  within = exactMatch(postbomb ~ immigrant, wrkdat))


## Following Rosenbaum Chapter 8: mahalanobis distance with propensity caliper
## fm1<-fullmatch(mhDistMat+caliper(psDistMat,1)+caliper(absdist,10),data=newdata)
fm1<-fullmatch(mhDistMat+caliper(psDistMat,1),data=newdata)

summary(fm1,max.controls=Inf,propensity.model=propensityModel)
table(matched(fm1))

xb2<-xBalance(postbomb~.,strata=list(unstrat=NULL,fm1=~fm1),
	      data=newdata,
	       report=c("std.diffs","z.scores","adj.means",
                    "adj.mean.diffs", "chisquare.test","p.values"))


wrkdat$fm1<-as.factor(fm1)
effect6lm<-lm(hlphrs~postbomb+fm1,data=wrkdat)
coef(effect6lm)[[2]]

xBalance(postbomb~hlphrs,strata=list(unstrt=NULL,fm1=~fm1),
	 data=wrkdat,report=c("std.diffs","z.scores","adj.means",
                    "adj.mean.diffs", "chisquare.test","p.values"))

```

Your friend then asks for help. Which estimate of the effect of the bombing
should she use in her report? Why? Is there another summary of the pre-vs-post
bombing behavior that she should be using?


```{r }
save(fm1,file="fm1.rda")
```
